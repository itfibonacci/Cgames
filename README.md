# Things to consider
- We need a game loop
- Need a function that is responsible for outputting random food on the screen
- Need to keep track of the snake's body, direction, (speed)
- Collision detection
- Input handling to change the snake's direction

# February 8
## Bugs at the moment
- The game only finishes when the snake collides with the top and left corners not left and bottom.
