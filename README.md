# Things to consider
- We need a game loop - done
- Need a function that is responsible for outputting random food on the screen - done
- Need to keep track of the snake's body, direction, (speed) - speed is left only
- Collision detection - done
- Input handling to change the snake's direction - done
- need to properly remove the tail from the screen as the snake moves
- add to the collision the case where the snake collides with its own body

# February 8
## Bugs at the moment
- The game only finishes when the snake collides with the top and left corners not left and bottom. - done
